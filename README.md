## Process, Challenges and how did I overcame them.
1. First, the process. I first thought about making this portfolio after my wordpress project on CMS. I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could replicate the same end-result thanks to my coding abilities only. I therefore based this project on both my [wordpress](https://aminemenhich.com/), and my adobe XD high-fidelity wireframes that we did for our UX course. The latter included 3 main pages, which you can find now on this project.
2. The main challenges were to learn bootstrap as it was a new framework to me. It had both ups and downs. 
On the one hand, the ups were that some processes were easier to build than with CSS, such as grids, and faster by just adding classes straight on html. Since it is also a reponsive and mobile-first framework, It made me gain so much time as I did not have to use media queries for this assignment thanks to the md,lg,sm... classes offered by bootstrap.
On the other hand, I felt somewhat limited on terms of what I could do and customize with bootstrap. With CSS, you can position your elements to a T, whereas on bootstrap you are somewhat limited by the templates offered.
3. I overcame most of these challenges by trial and error: practice makes perfect. I also did a lot of research both on google and youtube to find solutions to the issue I was facing. 

## Learning and Takeaway.

The main thing I learned was that things tend to appear scarier as they really are. As a student, we are subject to a lot of stress but I think that taking action is the best approach to overcome it. Immersing yourself in any subject can take you places, and in a few hours, you can learn to do something brand new (such as bootstrap for me). I of course also learned a lot about bootstrap and I really enjoyed its responsiveness as well as the inline styling for pretty much everything: grid, pictures, spacing etc... 
It was definitely more enjoyable than doing everything on CSS, but both are complementary. 

My goal now is to continue building on this portfolio. This would be just the foundation.
